The prompt wants me to analyze both the velocity and the intensity. Velocity, as I understand it in this context, refers to the speed – how fast or slow the notes are played. Intensity, on the other hand, is about the loudness, the amplitude of the sound.\n\nThe instruction tells me the velocity classification is based on whether it is greater than 75 or less than or equal to 75. Looking at the audio, the notes are spaced far apart with long pauses, they are very slow. Definitely not fast. That means the velocity is \"slow\".\n\nThen, for intensity, the instructions state that high intensity should be categorized by 'A' and low intensity should be categorized by 'B'. The sound is described as being played at a moderate to low volume – not very loud or forceful. That's a \"low\" intensity.\n\nNow, I re-read the prompt, \"Only answer 'A' or 'B'. Do not add any explanation, punctuation, or extra text.\" Therefore, even though I've classified velocity in my head, I'm only supposed to output the intensity classification. The prompt is very specific – only 'A' or 'B'.

The task is to analyze an audio clip, classify its \"velocity\" as either 'fast' or 'slow' based on a threshold of 75, and then output 'A' for high or 'B' for low depending on the classification.  Crucially, the prompt states that I'm supposed to use the audio clip to determine the velocity.\n\nRight, so I've got this sine sweep audio. My immediate thought is to calculate its sweep rate (Hz/s) to figure out this \"velocity\". To do that I need to determine the start frequency, end frequency, and the sweep's duration. I can’t get exact values just from listening, I'll need some kind of analysis tool for that. But, for now, let's try some estimation.\n\nThe sine sweep sounds pretty rapid. Listening again, it sweeps upwards, starting at a low frequency and rising sharply. I'd guess the duration is somewhere in the range of 2.5 to 3 seconds. The low end feels like around 100-200 Hz, and it goes up quite high, maybe to around 5-10 kHz.\n\nLet's do a rough calculation. Assuming a sweep from 100 Hz to 10,000 Hz, with a duration of 2.5 seconds, then the frequency range is 9900 Hz, divided by 2.5 seconds, gives me a velocity of about 3960 Hz/s. That's *way* above 75.\n\nBut then I stop.  The instructions explicitly say to classify based on 75, and that 'fast' should correspond to 'high' (output 'A') and 'slow' to 'low' (output 'B'). This simplifies things.\n\nOkay, let's re-evaluate. It seems I am supposed to classify the velocity relative to 75. Let's try another estimation, listening again.  It starts at around 100 Hz, perhaps goes up to 8 kHz, and lasts for approximately 2.8 seconds.  The frequency range is therefore about 7900 Hz, divided by 2.8 seconds. That gives me a sweep rate of about 2821 Hz/s. Still significantly higher than 75.\n\nThis analysis makes me confident that the velocity derived from the sweep is far greater than the threshold of 75, implying it’s 'fast' which corresponds to the output 'A'.  Given the context and the prompt, this is almost certainly what is wanted.\n\nA", "reference": "B"}

The task is to analyze this audio clip according to specific criteria: velocity (fast or slow), how it was struck (hard or soft), and the pitch (high or low). I need to nail this, and the output format is critical – just 'A' or 'B' for the final pitch classification.\n\nFirst things first: the audio. It's a single, sustained note, which immediately gives me some clues. I'm focusing on those attack and decay characteristics, and the initial strike is critical. The attack is definitely sharp, and the decay follows a distinctive pattern. Velocity... I'm leaning towards \"fast,\" over 75, based on the attack's immediacy. It wasn't a gradual crescendo; it hit right away.\n\nNext up, how it was struck. That initial impact? Absolutely key. This sound has a percussive quality at the onset, a bell-like resonance, then a sustained tone with what sounds like some overtones. This gives away that it was probably struck *hard*. Soft hits usually lack that immediate impact and subsequent resonance.\n\nNow for the pitch. Ah, yes, the meat and potatoes. I can hear the fundamental, and I know my instruments. This sounds definitively low. It's down in the bass register - tuba, maybe a very low trombone, definitely brassy in character. No question, it's a \"low\" pitch.\n\nSo, let's put it all together. Fast velocity, struck hard, and low pitch. The ultimate goal, the output: 'A' for high or 'B' for low. Since the pitch is undeniably low, that gives me a clear answer. The final answer, for the win, is *B*.\n\nB", "reference": "B"}

My initial instinct is that it refers to tempo. It *could* refer to MIDI velocity if this were, say, a MIDI file. But it isn't. Given that, it probably is tempo, that is, the speed of the audio events, given that it is an audio file.\n\nSo, I’m thinking about the audio clip. The description says it has spaced-out, percussive sounds – maybe woodblocks. My initial impression is that the tempo is slow.\n\nLet's estimate the tempo. Five hits in about 3 seconds, so roughly 100 BPM. Okay, *that* would be \"fast\" then, using the given rule of thumb for classification. But...\n\nThere's the confusing part about \"note intensity\". Does that mean loudness or am I misinterpreting the actual parameter?\n\nOkay, let's recalibrate. If \"velocity\" is really about the speed, tempo is really what I'm looking for. The sounds are deliberately placed, not rapid.\nIf I count the beats, one per second. That gives me 60 BPM. So, that's definitely \"slow\".\n\nWait, I should confirm by checking each beat:\n\n...[counts each event across time]...\n\nWell, that's the equivalent of 60 BPM or so. Therefore, based on the provided classification rule, it's definitely \"slow\" or \"low velocity.\"\n\nB", "reference": "A"}

{"audio_path": "/home/syr/sonicbench_data/velocity/task_recog/velocity_single_049.wav", "prompt": "Here is an audio clip. Classify the velocity as fast if it is greater than 75; otherwise, classify it as slow. Can you tell if the velocity is high or low? Answer 'A' for high, 'B' for low. Only answer 'A' or 'B'. Do not add any explanation, punctuation, or extra text. ", "prediction": "Okay, here's how I'm approaching this. The user wants me to classify the velocity based on an audio clip, simple enough. The task is to categorize it as 'fast' or 'slow' based on the clip, and that'll translate to 'high' or 'low', and finally, an 'A' or a 'B'. Easy peasy, really.\n\nFirst thing, I need to listen to that clip. Alright, here we go... Hmm, beeps. Quite rapid beeps, I must say. Seems like a short duration – maybe a second, maybe two. Within that timeframe, there are *multiple* beeps. It's almost... well, it sounds like a very fast sequence. I'd need a proper spectral analysis to be certain, to get a proper count, but my *perception* is that it's quick.\n\nNow, if I try to estimate the frequency... Let's say it's about 1.5 seconds long. I'm *hearing* roughly 8-10 beeps in that window. So, if we take the lower end, 8 in 1.5 seconds, that's roughly 5.33 beeps per second. At the high end, 10 in 1.5 seconds, that's almost 6.7 beeps per second. Of course, all this is based purely on the raw sound, and my aural memory. I'm basing all of this on a single listening.\n\nBut here's the kicker: the prompt says \"classify the velocity as fast if it is greater than 75.\" Okay, that's pretty clear. What's not clear is what the units are. Seventy-five *what*? Beeps per second? It's left ambiguous. That's a little frustrating. But I can't let that stop me.\n\nSo, this clip's got a rapid series of beeps. In many real-world scenarios, a high frequency usually *implies* a high velocity. Think of a Geiger counter, or a radar, or any sensor, really. So, based on the nature of the audio, it's highly *probable* that the implied velocity is \"fast.\" If fast, then we're talking \"high.\" And if it's \"high\", the answer is 'A'.\n\nStill, let me re-listen and see if I can refine my assessment of the rate, even without proper analysis. *Re-listening...* Yes, the beeps are *very* close together. Almost a continuous buzz with distinct pulses. Definitely a high rate. No question about it. If I had to make an *educated* guess, the rate is well above a slow, deliberate pace. If 75 is the threshold and my auditory estimation of the clip is correct, the beeps are likely *above* 75 of whatever units are being used here.\n\nTherefore, the velocity is \"fast\". \"Fast\" velocity means \"high\" velocity. \"High\" velocity, according to the prompt, means the answer is 'A'. So, my assessment is: **A**.\n\nA", "reference": "B"}
