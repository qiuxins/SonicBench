Therefore, the answer is not 'A' or 'B'. I will state the count and then provide the answer based on the user's specific instruction set. The user's instruction set is incomplete for a count of 6. I will state the count and then provide the answer as per the user's format. The user's format only provides two options, A or B. Since the count is 6, neither A nor B is correct.
