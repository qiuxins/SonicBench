The squeak sound is significantly shorter than this threshold.\n3.  **Answer Selection:** Based on the duration of the squeak, I can determine whether it is longer than 2.4 seconds or shorter than 2.4 seconds. Since the squeak is shorter than 2.4 seconds, the answer is B.\n</REASONING>\n<SUMMARY>\nThe audio clip contains a squeak sound that lasts approximately 1.5 seconds. This duration is shorter than the specified threshold of 2.4 seconds. Therefore, the answer is B.\n</SUMMARY>\n</THINK>\n<RESPONSE>\nB\n</RESPONSE>\n"}
