The tempo can be assessed by counting the number of beats within a specific time frame, such as a 15-second clip. If the beats are grouped in a way that suggests a high number of beats per unit of time, the tempo is likely fast. Conversely, if the beats are grouped in a way that suggests a low number of beats per unit of time, the tempo is likely slow.\n2.  **Tempo Determination:** After listening to the audio, I can clearly hear a consistent and rapid drum beat. Counting the beats within a 15-second clip, I observe approximately 12-13 beats. This suggests a tempo faster than 100 beats per minute (BPM).\n3.  **Tempo Categorization:** Based on the above assessment, the tempo is categorized as fast.\n</REASONING>\n<SUMMARY>\nThe audio clip features a drum beat with a consistent and rapid rhythm.
