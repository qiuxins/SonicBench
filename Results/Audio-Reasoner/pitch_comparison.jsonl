The first sound is a short, high-pitched \"ding\" or chime. The second sound is a lower-pitched, sustained tone that resembles a horn or similar instrument.

Shrill sounds are often perceived as harsh, grating, or unpleasant due to their high frequency content.\nBased on the audio, the first sound, the \"ding,\" is a short, high-pitched sound. It is likely to be perceived as acute. The second sound, the horn-like tone, is lower in pitch and sustained. It is likely to be perceived as shrill.\nComparing the two sounds, the \"ding\" is more likely to be perceived as acute, while the horn-like tone is more likely to be perceived as shrill.\n</REASONING>\n<SUMMARY>\nThe first sound, the \"ding,\" is more likely to be perceived as acute due to its high pitch and short duration. The second sound, the horn-like tone, is more likely to be perceived as shrill due to its lower pitch and sustained nature.
